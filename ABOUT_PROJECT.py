st.info(''' A sales performance dashboard is a visual representation of key sales metrics and performance indicators, typically presented in a graphical format. It provides a concise and easy-to-understand overview of the sales team's performance, allowing managers and stakeholders to quickly assess progress and identify areas that need improvement. Sales performance dashboards are commonly used in various industries, including car dealerships, to track and optimize sales efforts.

In the context of a car dealership, a sales performance dashboard would include data and metrics related to the sales of vehicles and associated activities. Some of the key components and metrics typically found in a car dealership's sales performance dashboard may include:

Vehicle Sales: The total number of cars sold during a specific period, which could be daily, monthly, quarterly, or yearly.

Revenue and Profit: The total revenue generated from vehicle sales and the associated profit margins. This helps to gauge the financial health of the dealership.

Salesperson Performance: Individual salesperson metrics, such as the number of cars sold, revenue generated, conversion rates, and customer satisfaction scores. This allows managers to identify top-performing salespeople and those who may need additional support or training.

Lead Conversion Rate: The percentage of leads that result in actual car sales. This metric helps evaluate the efficiency of the sales team in converting potential customers into buyers.

Inventory Turnover: How quickly the dealership's inventory of cars is being sold and replaced with new vehicles. A high inventory turnover rate indicates efficient sales operations.

Average Selling Price: The average price at which cars are sold. This metric is essential for pricing strategies and understanding customer preferences.

Sales by Vehicle Model: A breakdown of sales performance by different car models. This information can guide inventory management and marketing efforts.
